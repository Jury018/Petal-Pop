Petal Pop - Game Description (Version 0.1)

Welcome to Petal Pop, an exciting, colorful match-3 puzzle game inspired by the iconic Candy Crush series! Currently under development, Petal Pop brings you into a world of vibrant flowers and sweet combinations, where you'll need to match 3 or more of the same color to score points and unlock special combos.

In this early version (0.1), weâ€™re laying the foundation for an addictive gameplay experience. The game features:
